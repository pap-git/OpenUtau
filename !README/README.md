# OpenUtau (pap's fork)
## Differences between this fork and original one
There's not much differences between this fork and original, but I added so few settings on this fork:
 - Changed Autosave filename
    - from `[project-name]-autosave.ustx` to `[project-name]-[date]-autosave.ustx`
    - if project name is "NeverGonnaGiveYouUp" and date is "2025-01-01 01:23:45" then: `NeverGonnaGiveYouUp-20250101012345-autosave.ustx`
    - You can change back them to original one (Settings -> Fork Settings)
 - Changed Backup/Autosave Location to /Backups folder
    - You can't change this one for now (idk ill add the settings it later)
 - Save notice when autosave failed 5 times (or failed %5 and if 0 then appear)

## To-do

[ ] idk i have no idea with this
